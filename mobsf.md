## Code Enhancement/Feature Requests

---

### **1. CSS file loading fail in China**

the page loading time is more than 15 seconds.
Because live-in China users do not access `fonts.googleapi.com` site.
Could we put the font file in the code repository or use CDN?

### **2. Find API keys/secrets by matching regex**

**If you're requesting a new feature/enhancement, explain why you'd like it to be added and it's importance.**

We currently have a feature which find possible hardcoded secrets. But there could be false positives. So I am suggesting a feature which will use regex to find API keys. I currently have a command line program called dora which does exactly this. But would of course be very nice if this was implemented into this program so we'd get exact matches to those API keys/secrets.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
It is not a problem.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Use a list of regex that match certain API keys/secrets so they will be found without any false positives. I am willing to provide the regex patterns if needed.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I currently use my program called dora but if MobSF had this inbuilt, it would be ease my workflow.

### **3. browse all files**

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe**.
I would like to see the source code for other files besides java and smali, i.e. html. Or download binary files (images, shared objects and so on).

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Allow the browser access all sorts of files

### **4. Split settings.py**

**If you're requesting a new feature/enhancement, explain why you'd like it to be added and it's importance.**

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
`settings.py` hosts both required MobSF/Django config and local config.
Each time MobSF version is updated, need to merge local settings (e.g., `USE_HOME`, DB config, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`) into the updated `settings.py`

~/MobSF/config.py allows for customizing some values, but can't host Django settings.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Split the file into settings.py and local_settings.py (ideally loaded from `~/.MobSF`).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Manual merge

**Additional context**
Django wiki about splitting settings: https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/SplitSettings

### **5. Sticky horizontal scrollbar in code/xml views**

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When some lines exceed the viewport width inside the source and smali code views or the Manifest XML view, a horizontal scrollbar is shown.
The problem is, it's all at the bottom of the view which forces the user to scroll all way down to adjust the horizontal scroll.
This interrupts the workflow and is distracting because you have to guess what width is needed to view a specific part of the line.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The horizontal scrollbar might be set to stick at the page bottom if it would be outside the viewport otherwise.

### **6. Create non root docker image**

If you're requesting a new feature/enhancement, explain why you'd like it to be added and it's importance.

It is not a good practise to run a docker image as root. It would be a good improvement to build this image with a lower privilege user, MobSF

### **7. Web UI elements overlap or spread afar on Mobile & big screen**

**ENVIRONMENT**

MobSF Version: 3.1.7 beta
OS and Version: Windows 10 Chrome , Android 9 Chrome

**EXPLANATION OF THE ISSUE**
When accessing the web interface via Chrome on Windows 10 or Chrome on Android the layout get "messy" with elements overlapping each other or, when zooming out, spread far from each other.
While on PC there is more freedom to resize a window and zoom-out, on Android 9 (~6 Inch screen) elements from table columns like images or buttons in the static analysis page or the search button on the main page overlap and cover other elements.

### **10. StaticAnalysis: Allow different source paths for Android Studio when using zip format**

**If you're requesting a new feature/enhancement, explain why you'd like it to be added and it's importance.**

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The zipped source code analysis expects Android Studio projects to have their source directory at app/src/main.
However, app/ can be named anything, based on the project's discretion. This means that the zip analysis does not work for a lot of projects who have chosen to name their source directory something else.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Detect the source directory automatically by searching.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
We could, maybe, specify a parameter indicating what the source directory is. However, this would disrupt the drag-and-drop upload experience that we currently have.

### **11. Specify versions of data sets used**

Some analysis results are time-dependent; specifically, reported ratings may change with each scan. This applies at least to:

1. all app metadata retrieved from AppStores
2. the certificate status of the signer certificate (Android)
3. domain malware checks (IP address, IP geolocation, status)
4. VirusTotal results
5. In order to make test results verifiable and possible differences between two scans comprehensible, a consistent versioning if the data sets used is necessary.

Currently, only the scan date is specified when using the VirusTotal API.

I suggest to add the following information to JSON Report API:

- time at which an analysis started
- time at which an analysis was completed (since not all analysis steps are executed in the very beginning and all at once)
- the version string (if available) and the time at which a data set was successfully updated the last time (for example, the Malware Analysis or IP Geolocation data sets may be cached)

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
This is useful for malware and forensic analysis. Support frida based memory dumping

https://github.com/Nightbringer21/fridump

**Describe the solution you'd like**

### **13. Dynamic Analysis of iOS apps utilizing jailbroken iPhones**

**If you're requesting a new feature/enhancement, explain why you'd like it to be added and it's importance.**
The importance of being able to dynamically analyze iOS apps is no difference then the importance of being able to dynamically analyze Android Apps. With the release of exploits for iOS, such as the permanent unpatchable bootrom exploit, many security researchers have the ability to utilize this to perform dynamic analysis of apps on iOS with ease.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The problem being that dynamic analysis of IPA's is not supported with MobSF.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Tools such as GrapeFruit https://github.com/ChiChou/Grapefruit or https://github.com/chaitin/passionfruit are good references to the capabilities that are missing. Implementing the features such as recording traffic, like we can in Android and running Frida scripts.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Using tools such as GrapeFruit https://github.com/ChiChou/Grapefruit or https://github.com/chaitin/passionfruit

### **14. Provide codes for simplified classification of issues**

The JSON reporting API should be extended so that parsing to distinguish different issues is no longer necessary. Introducing such issue codes would greatly simplify machine processing.

**Examples:**

iOS App Transport Security (ATS) issues:
I suggest issue codes based on the triggered expression.

- Insecure communication to xxx.xxx.xxx is allowed -> Either NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads or NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads
- NSIncludesSubdomains set to TRUE for xxx.xxx.xxx -> NSIncludesSubdomainsAllowed
- NSExceptionMinimumTLSVersion set to TLSv1.1 on xxx.xxx.xxx -> NSExceptionMinimumTLSVersion11
- ...

Issues in other sections do not contain contextual information (or provide a field like name in the Android manifest analysis) afaik. However, it is desirable to use a one-word code instead of a sentence - the former is imho less likely to be edited.

### **15. Add "Submit" button in VirusTotal section**

Our investigation on mobile app sometime dealing with application in development and we have to disable auto submit to VirusTotal.
But sometime deal with malware or app store application which is available publicly.
Adding "Submit" button in VirusTotal section will be helpful if we need to submit the application to VirusTotal manually.

### **16. Assets.car parser**

Hi, thanks a lot for working on this tool.

During a recent .IPA file review, I discovered multiple Assets.car files with BOMStore header.
After a quick google, I found the following article:
https://blog.timac.org/2018/1112-quicklook-plugin-to-visualize-car-files/

He released few tools (with source code), however they are all for OSX sources.

I was wondering if you can find/write a cross-platform alternative and include this parser into MobSF

Thanks

### **17. Better handling of info.plist files in IOS Source**

If you're requesting a new feature/enhancement, explain why you'd like it to be added and it's importance.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When working with large IOS projects, it is not uncommon, at least in our org, that projects are structured into modules.
Each module has their own info.plist. This causes some problems with mobSF as it appears to simply pick the first info.plist if finds (when scanning IOS Source, it is not an issue in binary as all the plist's are combined into one), which could easily be a sub-module instead of the actual app.

Furthermore, you are free to name the info.plist file as you please. It does not have to be called info.plist.
I would like to hear some opinions on how to solve this and if it even should be solved. Maybe we're the only ones with this issue?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Perhaps we could have an optional parameter, in the scan api call, with the name of the configuration that gets built. That way, it could check the project.pbxproj file, and find that configuration.
In the configuration, in the project file, it shows the path the info.plist file and also values that you might replace, in it, using variable placeholders.
Combining these two things could potentially give you the proper info.plist content.

### **19. Allow for CSV export of findings**

**If you're requesting a new feature/enhancement, explain why you'd like it to be added and it's importance.**

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I use this tool for FedRAMP penetration testing against Federal companies. As such, there are very strict documentation standards. Allowing export of a CSV file would greatly streamline my reporting as currently I am having to copy/paste from PDFs unless I want to work on the report instantly.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like a function added that could either export as CSV or even XML that could be converted to CSV through scripting in Python. Anything but a PDF that cannot be properly parsed.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I am currently working on attempting to pull the HTML down and use Beautiful soup to perform the parsing, however I feel that if I am needing this functionality, multiple other people may be wanting it as well.

### **20. Mobile-Security API-Framework-MobSF within MISP Project about IOC**

By doing static analysis and dynamic analysis of malware for android, ios and windows mobile, we can find several IOCs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_of_compromise)
these IOCs could be automatically inserted via Mobile-Security API-Framework-MobSF within MISP Project by creating automatic events:
https://www.misp-project.org/features.html
That would be a huge feature for Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF, before the MISP Project and Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF, will be seen by over 6,000,000 renowned institutions worldwide.

### **23. Android Static Analysis test request**

Internal username and path disclosure:
I believe this also applies to iOS but apple strips this data out before it goes to iTunes.
If you run strings \*|grep "/Users/" on any of the compiled library .so files you get the username of the developer who compiled the binary. You also get the folder structure/layout of the developers local machine.
That is if they are running on a mac. Similar strings could be searched for windows/nix based.
Love the tool, thanks!

### **24. Please add code path diagrams**

**EXPLANATION OF THE ISSUE**
I had a feature request that would really improve MobSF. Are you able to add code path diagrams.
This would make tracking back through the code much easier. At present you have to keep searching for where functions are called.

### **31. Integration of Library Detection & Analysis into MobSF.**

Hi!
As we approach the final semester of our bachelor at Saarland University, a friend of mine and me are doing a project this semester. We have been assigned to integrate Android library detection & anaylsis techniques into a popular mobile security analysis tool.
We have chosen MobSF as framework, and will be integrating LibScout, as well as LibID into the static analysis routine of MobSF.
As I like contributing to open source, I wanted to ask if you'd be interested in a pull request once work is finished.
Greetings!
